I am currently pursuing my master's degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University. Under the guidance of Professor [Amjad, Tehmina](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i9ZfQHUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), I am part of a team of dedicated researchers who are keen to explore the vast horizons of information retrieval and related fields. From semantic analysis to machine learning, data mining, social network analysis, etc., and always at the forefront of advancing knowledge and innovation in the digital age. I received my MS and BS degrees from Nanjing University and Southeast University respectively.
